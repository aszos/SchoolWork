/*
Linked Lists (for queues)
- A chain of identical entities (called nodes) contains data AND a pointer(s) to other nodes.
- The connectivity of the pointers are linear.
- Each linked list has a first/head and a last/tail.

Singly Linked List
- A linked list with a node pointing to another node

Inside the Node
- Data = "p"
- Pointer ->

Doubly  Linked List
- A linked list with a node pointing to the node in front and the one behind it.

For array implementations of gueues, front and back are INDICIES!
For SLL implementations of queues, front and back are POINTERS!


Enqueue
1. Make an empty node
2. Put element in it
3. Make its next point to back
4. Make back point to this
