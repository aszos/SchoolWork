Pseudocode for Robot Dolphin Rodeo

1. Read graph G
     (Use Skiena's read_graph)
2. Determine strong components of G
     (Use Skiena's  strong.c)
3. Build strong component graph C 
     (Vertices are strong components of G)
4. Discover sinks 
     (Out-degree is 0 in C)
5. Discover sources  (how?)
     (In-degree is 0 in C, How to know this?)
6. Write list of vertices (rodos - the base candidates) in the single source component 
     (and give empty list if there are multiple sources)
7. Write list of vertices (rodos - the sponge candidates) in the single sink component 
     (and give empty list if there are multiple sinks)
