##Software Process Models 
### Waterfall
	- A sequential design process in which progress is seen as flowing steadily 
	downwards through the phases of:
		• Conception
		• Initiation
		• Analysis
		• Design
		• Construction
		• Testing
		• Production / Implementation
		• Maintenance
	- A hardware-oriented model. Was adapted because no other models were in available.
	- One should only move to a phase oece the preceding phase is reviewed and verified.
		-> Because moving back a phase would be costly.
### Incremental
	- A "multi-waterfall" cycle.
	- Parts of the final product are put through waterfall model.
	- A working version of software is produced during the first module.
		-> Needs good planning and design
		-> Need clear definition of the entire system
		-> Higher cost than a single waterfall
### Agile 
	- Many different models available, similar goal
	- Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS)
	- Requirement Prioritization
	- Much more flexible for fast changing environment
	- Difficult to apply to large teams
	- Sharing and collaberation is paramount 
	- Limited based on modeling skills
### Scrum
	- Agile Software Development framework 
	- "a flexible, holistic product development strategy"
	- Composed of many sprints
		- a "timeboxed" effort
		- lasts between one week to one month (two weeks typical)

##libGDX concepts
### Drawing sprites/text
	- Handled by OpenGL through OpenGL viewport
	- SpriteBatch
		-> Sends all images as one message to GPU
		-> How to use 
			1. Instantiate SpriteBatch
			2. call .begin()
			3. call .draw() images/text on each texture you wish to show
			4. .end() when done drawing
	- Texture
		-> Class that handles images
		-> Decodes images and loads into GPU memory	
	- TextureRegion	
		-> Same thing as texture
		-> Display regions of a texture
	- Sprite
		-> Both a texture region, the geometry of where it will be drawn, and color
### Handling user input
	- Input Module
		-> Gdx.input...
		-> InputProcessor
			- Interface that has built in methods for user input
			- Create class, implement InputProcessor, instantiate in classes
			where you need to handle user input
			- Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(inputProcessor);	
### render() 
	-> Called every 30/50/80 times per second 
		- Depends on Frames per Second
	-> If you disable continious rendering, can only trigger render() when...
		1. An input event is triggered
		2. Gdx.graphics.requestRendering() is called
		3. Gdx.app.postRunnable is called

##UML 
	- use cases
	- sequence diagrams
	- class diagrams

##Java Concepts 
### Exceptions 
	- An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal
	flow of instructions.
	- When an errors occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it
	off to the runtime system.
	- Call Stack
		^	Method where error occurred          
		|	Method without an exception handler  
		|	Method with an exception handler     
		|	main 				     
	- Runtime system searches for something in stack to catch the exception
		-> if none is found, runtime system terminates
	- Three types of Exceptions	
		-> Check Exception
			- Check for anything unexpected or not correct input
		-> Runtime Exception
			- Internal runtime problems
		-> Unchecked Exceptions
			- Errors and runtime exceptions 
### Enumerations
	- Constant values that cannot be changed.
	- public enum <name of enum class>	
	- Instantiate as if it were a normal class, refer to parts as properties
### Garbage Collection
	- Definition: the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects 
	are in use and which are not and deleting unused objects.
	- Steps of Automatic Garbage Collection
		1. Marking
			- Identifying which pieces of memory is being used. 
		2. Normal Deletion
			- Removing of unreferenced objects leaving reference objects and pointers
			 to free space.
			a. Deleting with Compacting
				- Compact remaining objects after deleting
	- JMV Generations
		- Young Generation
			-> New objects are allocated and aged.
			-> When full, causes a minor garbage collection.
				- Stop the World Event!
					- Stops all threads and cleans things up before resuming.
		- Old Generation
			-> Long surviving objects.
			-> There exists some sort of threshold for Young to Old
			-> Major Garbage Collection
		- Permanent Generation
			-> Classes and Methods.
			-> Full Garbage collection.
		- We cannot delete objects! The Garbage collector takes care of that.
### Polymorphism 
		- See Lab 3!
