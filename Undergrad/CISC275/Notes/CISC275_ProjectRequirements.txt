Requirement (not a goal!):
This project would be a fun and educational game that would allow the UD to assess studentsâ€™ knowledge

Personal Notes:
- Imagine AlcoholEDU, but a lot better.
- Role-playing game, adventure game as a front-end
- Backend, needs to show where students struggled and had problems
- Students need to know how to do Degree Audit, how courses work
- Use students outside of UD, outside of major (CSW)
- We can use UD branded things
- Teaching and testing, not just testing
- Consider mastery approach (repeat until failure, show how many failures)
- Short game, think less than an hour

Personal Ideas:
- Adventure Games, Puzzle based (think King's Quest, Nancy Drew, Monkey Island, etc.)
- Adviser helping students, (think Tapper)
- Look at popular games for inspiration (something that's simple to play)
