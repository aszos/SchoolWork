CISC 220 Introduction Notes

Pillars of CISC220
1. Defining * in the abstract
2. Implementing * in C++  
3. Analyzing the performance of * in terms of time and space
4. Applying * to real-world problems 
(* = data types and algorithms)


Error checking in C++
- Uninitialized local variables
- Increase security and efficiency
- No array bounds checking
- Dereferencing null pointers
