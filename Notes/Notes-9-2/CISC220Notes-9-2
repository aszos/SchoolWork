	1. What would be the output of couting sizeof(s), if s = "cat"?
	Answer: 8 bytes are allocated for an address, sizeof(s) prints how big is an address?
	
	2. What would be the output of couting sizeof(*s), if s = "cat"?
	Answer: *s points to the first character of the character sequence. *s = s[0].
