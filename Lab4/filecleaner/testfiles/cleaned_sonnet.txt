shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
thou art more lovely and more temperate 
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may 
and summer's lease hath all too short a date 
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines 
and oft' is his gold complexion dimm'd 
and every fair from fair sometime declines 
by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd 
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest 
nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade 
when in eternal lines to time thou growest 

so long as men can breathe  or eyes can see 
so long lives this  and this gives life to thee
